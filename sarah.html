		<div id="about_me" class="container-fluid item" >
			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>To learn a little bit more about me, scroll through the topics below! You can also jump to the topics you are interested in by selecting it from the navigation panel.</p>
			
		</div>

		<div id="school" class="container-fluid item" >
			<h1>Colorado School of Mines</h1>
			<p>I am a senior studying Engineering Physics and Computer Science. I will graduate with my Bachelors in Engineering Physics this May, then I am going to stick around to finish a masters degree in Computer Science. I hope to one day work in the Aerospace industry. Specifically, I would love to work in the space exploration field working on rovers or satelites and telescopes! </p>
			
		</div>

		<div id="alpine" class="container-fluid item" >
			<h1>Alpine Ski Racing</h1>
			<p>I have been an alpine ski racer since I can remember! I started skiing for Eldora Mountain Ski Club (EMSC) when I was bout 7 years old, then shuffled through a few ski teams as I grew up. In highschool, I raced for Team Summit in Summit County. We skied 6 days a week, which required me to take a lot of my classes online as independent study or over the summer. Once I got to college, I coached younger racers for EMSC for two years. I raced for the Colorado School of Mines club ski team for 4 years until I aged out. It has been an integral part of my life, and I plan to continue being envolved in the ski racing community, either by competting or coaching, for a long time.</p>
			
		</div>

		<div id="music" class="container-fluid item">
			<h1>Music</h1>
			<p>I love music of all kinds and enjoy performing in musical ensembles. I play oboe in the CSM Concert Band and Symphony Orchestra. Additionally, I have performed with small ensembles and quintents. Music the perfect outlet for technical arts when working so hard in a rigourous engineering program.</p>
			
		</div>

		<div id="outreach" class="container-fluid item" >
			<h1>Outreach</h1>
			<p>While at Mines, I have had the opportunity multiple outreach programs. I work as an Instructor for the DECTech program which aims to introduces young girls to STEM. In this program I get to develop hands on lessons to introduce the basic topics in STEM to the class in a interactive and fun way. This program has also given me the opportunity to reach out to the community. I have gotten to talk about STEM at various community events such as the Girls Lead the Way event on the CSM campus as well as go to other schools such as STEM Day at Rocky Mountain Deaf School. /p>
			
		</div>

		<div id="extra" class="container-fluid item" >
			<h1>Extracurriculars</h1>
			<p>I am a Brother of the Honorary Band Service Fraternity Kappa Kappa Psi. This organization focusses on serving college band programs and improving musicality. I have served in multiple leader roles including Chapter Historian and District Secretary Treasurer. The organization pushes me to strive for the highest in everything I do, even outside of music, and has introduced me to many life long friends. </p>
			

		</div>

		<div id="likes" class="container-fluid item" >
			<h1>Obsessions</h1>
			<p>I like to play some video games when I have time, but I am absolutely obsessed with the Legend of Zelda! Odds are that any background on any electronic device I have is Zelda based in some way. </p>
			<p>I also enjoy reading when I can. I tend to read sci-fi or fantasy books, but also love mystery and thriller type stories such as books written by John Grisham or Steven King. </p>
			<p>Whenever I put something on to listen to, I typically reach for a podcast or radio talk show. I like being able to listen to stories or learn while I am doing other activities like driving. Some of my favorits are the Johnjay and Rich show, the NVC podcast, Tony Robins, and Invisibilia!</p>
