                <p> Hello! My name is Sam Schilling and I'm the second member of the DT (Dream Team) crew. Read the sections below to learn a little more about me! </p>

                <h4 class="display-4 text-primary">Education</h4>
                <p> I am currently in my final semester of my master's degree in Computer Science at Colorado School of Mines. I graduated with my bachelor's degree in Computer Science in May of 2017, so this is my 5th year being a part of this community! I have loved my time here and have learned a lot of interesting things about computer science throughout my time here.</p>

                <h4 class="display-4 text-primary">Personal Life</h4>
                I was born near Chicago and have two sisters and a brother. I moved to Indiana for two years during 3rd and 4th grade, and then came out to Colorado, where I have been ever since. I love the weather and scenery out here in Colorado and plan on staying here for the forseeable future. I am an uncle of two awesome kids (seen in my graduation picture, they are great despite the frowns!), and like to spend time with my girlfriend Maleah. In my spare time I like playing piano, basketball, video games, and also making my own games on occasion.

                <h4 class="display-4 text-primary">Personal Projects</h4>
                <p> I have been interested in programming since I was 12 years old, so I have created a number of personal projects over the years. Some were for school, some were not, but all of them were fun to work on! See some of them highlighted below.</p>

                <p>Aside from everything I've mentioned so far, I also compete in competive Super Smash Bros. for Wii U! I have been ranked everywhere from #3 to #10 in the state of Colorado, and I have even competed against the undisputed best player in the world (ZeRo) in the past. Yes, I lost, but it was still fun! Below is a banner showing a past ranking where I was #7 in Colorado.</p>
